# arnexport

> Creates an AWS CloudFormation template in YAML format from an AWS resource ARN.

This script will create a CloudFormation template that should pass aws cloudformation validation but;
The template itself may not be usable without some tweaking. For example, Lambda functions export with
a code property that can't be used by CloudFormation as is. The script in it's current state does
produce a fairly useable template suitable for editing.
